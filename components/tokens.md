# Tokens

## JAM - Cash <a id="bac-basis-cash"></a>

Basis Cash tokens are designed to be used as a medium of exchange. The built-in stability mechanism expands and contracts their supply, maintaining their peg to the MakerDAO **Multi-Collateral Dai** token \(which roughly trades near the United States Dollar\).

## JAB -  Bonds <a id="bab-basis-bonds"></a>

JAM Bonds are minted and redeemed to incentivize changes in the **JAM** Cash supply. Bonds are always on sale to **JAM** Cash holders, although purchases are expected to be made at a price below $1 **JAM** Cash. At any given time, holders are able to exchange their JAB bonds to **JAM** tokens in the Basis Cash Treasury. Upon redemption, they are able to convert **1** JAB Bond to **1** JAM Cash, earning them a premium on their previous bond purchases.

JAB Bonds do not have expiration dates. All holders are able to convert their bonds to JAM Cash tokens, as long as the Treasury has a positive JAM balance.

## JAZZ -  Shares <a id="bab-basis-bonds"></a>

JAZZ Shares loosely represent the value of the JAM network. Increased demand for JAM results in new JAM tokens to be minted and distributed to JAZZ holders, provided that the Treasury is sufficiently full.

Holders of JAZZ Share tokens can claim a pro-rata share of JAM Cash tokens accumulated to the Boardroom contract.
