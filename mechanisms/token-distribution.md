# Token Distribution

10 week bootstrapping - target is 100m MC of HASH

Pre-Boardroom distribution;

## HASH \(Cash\) Distribution;

 20k Wallet Limit 50k HASH Distributed over 7 days. 

Starting stable farm - Earn HASH by staking one of these currencies:

ESD AMPL DSD BAC USDC

Boardroom begins: 7 Days from stable farm launch  block time countdown will be set 7 days from launch start time

## HASHeS \(Shares\) Distribution;

100k linearly for first 10 weeks 

Thereafter Halving distribution; 50k for next 10 weeks, 25k for next 10 weeks, etcâ€¦.

HASH/USDC pool mines HASHeS: LP rewards goes live on day 2.

 HASH staking mines HASHeS \(Stake HASH to earn HASH\): Hash staking goes live 7 days after first boardroom. 

Rewards Distribution Split Between HASH/USDC Pool \(for deep liquidity when needed\) & Pure HASH Staking \(For Capital Efficiency!\)

Rewards are designed to incentivise the right balance between capital in Liquidity Pools & Capital in DAO \(Like bonding to DAO in ESD\)

\*In the table below the %/% signifys the rewards split between LP rewards/ and HASH staking rewards

| HASH/USDC mines HASHeS | HASHes Per week | Percent of total | HASH staking in DAO mines HASHeS \(Stake HASH to earn HASH\) |
