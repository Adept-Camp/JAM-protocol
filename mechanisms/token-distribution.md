# Token Distribution Thanks to @sabretooth :)

10 week bootstrapping - target is 100m MC of JAM

Pre-Boardroom distribution;

## JAM \(Cash\) Distribution;

 20k Wallet Limit 50k JAM Distributed over 7 days. 

Starting stable farm - Earn JAM by staking one of these currencies:

ESD AMPL DSD BAC USDC

Boardroom begins: 7 Days from stable farm launch  block time countdown will be set 7 days from launch start time

## JAZZ \(Shares\) Distribution;

100k linearly for first 10 weeks 

JAM distribution dropping 10% every 10 weeks?

This is is keeping with the original basis distribution, but instead of distributing it over 1 year, it will now be a 6 year distribution(99%) with ~40% of tokens distributed in the first year.

The difference in the first year is ~200k vs ~400k JAZZ, but the next 5 years will have ~0 vs ~600k, so it gives community more breathing room.



JAM/USDC pool mines JAZZ: LP rewards goes live on day 2.

 JAM staking mines JAZZ \(Stake JAM to earn JAZZ\): JAM staking goes live 7 days after first boardroom. 

Rewards Distribution Split Between JAM/USDC Pool \(for deep liquidity when needed\) & Pure JAM Staking \(For Capital Efficiency!\)

Rewards are designed to incentivise the right balance between capital in Liquidity Pools & Capital in DAO \(Like bonding to DAO in ESD\)

\*In the table below the %/% signifys the rewards split between LP rewards/ and HASH staking rewards

| JAM/USDC mines JAZZ | JAZZ Per week | Percent of total | JAM staking in DAO mines JAZZ \(Stake JAM to earn JAZZ\) |
