## Distribution of JAZZ after the first 10 weeks

JAZZ distribution drops 10% every 10 weeks.

Total distribution is then 1m in keeping with the original basis distribution, but instead of distributing it over 1 year, it will now be a 6 year distribution\(99%\) with ~40% of tokens distributed in the first year.

The difference in the first year is ~200k vs ~400k JAZZ, but the next 5 years will have ~0 vs ~600k, so it gives community more breathing room.
