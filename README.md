Welcome to the Basis Cash documentation!

**Basis Cash** is an open-source, permissionless algorithmic stablecoin.

The Basis Cash protocol aims to revive the original vision of [**basis.io**](https://basis.io/), initially released as a lightweight implementation on the **Ethereum** blockchain.

Adding ideas and innovations made since the original Basis project shut down, the Basis Cash team has made modifications to the original mechanism outlined with its [whitepaper](http://basis.io/basis_whitepaper_en.pdf). Read on for further details.
