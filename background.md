# Background

The price volatility of cryptocurrencies is a major blocker for mass adoption. Their rapid change in fiat-denominated value causes payment values to vary even during settlement times, being highly inconvenient to merchants that handle them.

**Stablecoins** are cryptocurrencies with an exchange rate peg with existing fiat currencies \(such as the United States dollar\) or a fiat-related index, thereby drastically increasing their usefulness as a payment medium.

## Algorithmic Central Banks <a id="algorithmic-central-banks"></a>

Although there exists a wide variety of stablecoin mechanisms, Basis Cash specifically uses an “algorithmic central bank” approach to manage the supply of tokens according to a predetermined logic. The algorithm is in charge of balancing stablecoin supply to fluctuating demand, ensuring that the token price remains relatively stable. Further details are available under the [Mechanisms](mechanisms/stabilization-mechanism.md) section.
